To keep things organized, please follow these steps:

### âœ… How to Contribute

1. **Create an Issue**  
   Open a GitHub issue describing the task or bug you're tackling. If one already exists, assign yourself to it.

2. **Branch Naming**  
   Create a branch from `main` using the format:  
   `issue_number/feature-name` (e.g., `2/cleanup`, `1/spec_and_docs`)

3. **Make Commits**  
   Keep commits small and descriptive.

4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Reference the related issue (`Closes #issue-number`)  
   - Briefly explain your changes  
   - Ensure your code is linted and tested if applicable. (Details regrading this should be in the folder specific README)

5. **Review & Merge**  
   After review, your PR will be merged into `main`. Atleast one review is required for merge.
